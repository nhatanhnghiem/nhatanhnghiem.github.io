I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D student at C.N.Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics. Before that I obtained B.S degree in Physics from Department of Physics & Astronomy,  Stony Brook University.  During my undergraduate time,  I worked as student researcher at Brookaven National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

I am very honored to receive supervision of [Prof. Tzu-Chieh Wei](http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~twei/) since I was undergraduate student. Along the journey, I have been very fortunate to learn, either directly or indirectly,  from all people with fantastic minds.  Altogether, these experiences have fueled my passion for research, as well as shaped my career path in a very miraculous way. 

I am blessed with amazing friends, colleagues, and teachers in my life !
