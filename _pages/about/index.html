<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student at <a href="http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/itp/www/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">C.N.Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>. Before that I obtained B.S degree in Physics from Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy, Stony Brook University. During my undergraduate time, I worked as student researcher at Brookaven National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p> <p>My research is centered on the fascinating intersection of quantum computation and information theory. I am deeply intrigued by how the principles of quantum physics offer an entirely new paradigm for computing, enabling quantum computers to tackle complex computational challenges that pose significant hurdles for classical computers, including supercomputers.</p> <p>I am very honored to receive supervision of <a href="http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~twei/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Tzu-Chieh Wei</a> since I was undergraduate student. Along the journey, I have been very fortunate to learn, either directly or indirectly, from all people with fantastic minds. Altogether, these experiences have fueled my passion for research, as well as shaped my career path in a very miraculous way.</p> <p>I am blessed with amazing friends, colleagues, and teachers in my life !</p> </body></html>
